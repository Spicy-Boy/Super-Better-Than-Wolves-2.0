O-Custom death message for being stabbed to death by a knife. Also, clubs if there isn't one already.

O-New in-world crafting recipe: Pile of sticks -> Campfire

        right click again to create "X" of sticks (drops 2 sticks)
        right click again to add another stick on top (drops 3 sticks)
        right click again to create a campfire

***GOURD TODO***
O-Pumpkin Jack hitboxes do not conform to model... can that be fixed?

O-LEARN HOW HYDRATION AND PLANTS WORK IN MC

O-SNOW SMOTHERS CROPS

****

-!-Enderman Overhaul-!-

O-Remove purple particles from enderman

O-Make sounds way less frequent

O-Have endermen head look at you most of the time

-!-!-!-!

O- Added Yany's Hardcore Hell from Yany's Stuff&Things Addon

        >Big shout out to Yany, creator of amazing addons

O- Envelope item
    >stores nbt data of item, right click or uncraft to unwrap present

O-Add new gourd type, Wild Gourd

O-hardcore wittling

O-add pine box (basket copy with new texture, maybe high pitched sped up creak sound effect from normal chest?)
    -Takes 7 minutes total?
    -Wood Carving recipe (iron knife + spruce log)
    -UNCRAFT into knife with 1 reduced durability and + second item (Unfinished Wooden Box) that maintains the progress/damage value to be resumed
    

+=+=+ NEW CROPS / FARMING TWEAKS +=+=+
O - Changed how potatoes grow. 
   - Planting a potato in farmland buries it (use Sockthing's carrot/onion). Drops potato on first stage. Drops nothing if advances.
   - It will grow greenery out of top and eventually expand to cover the whole block (usual multi-potato texture). Drops 2-3 potatoes.
   - When fully grown (before flowering stage), begins to expand into adjacent fallow farmland. Colonist potato plants use a different texture


O- Added new types of rivers for each biome

O- Added wild carrots
    >Generate on the tops of mountains
    
O- CONSIDER ADDING FOUL SEED from corrupted pumpkin?? Creates a vine that never stops growing
        >grows infinitely
        >tough stem needs axe to cut through
        
        >Thorny, hurts players like modern berry bushes do
        >corrupted flowers spread corruption up to 10 blocks away
            >normal pumpkin stems will create corrupted flowers if within range of the nether portal
            >corrupted flowers create corrupted pumpkins, a black pumpkin with glowing red jack colors

MISC IDEAS:

```~~~```NEW EARLYGAME BLOCKS```~~~```
    O  - add reed thatch AKA new wicker block (described below, cant be walked on or used as support antigravity block)
        3 branches/sticks, sandwiched by 6 reeds
        can be broken with bare hand to retrieve block
        spider does not trigger fall
        
       NOTE ON IMPLEMENTATION: YOu can do this pretty easily, look at the snow code!!!!!!! Blocks of snow fall when walked on or when a block is placed on top of them

***CRUSHABLE BLOCK TYPE***
Thatch Properties:
    -can float (thatch, not branches)
    -"update" falls if walked on
    -if a falling block like cobblestone falls on it, the block is crushed into a few sticks with CRACK sound

    -Bundle of Sticks (halfslab, full block is block of sticks)
          place by shift right clicking on a spot with branches in hand, uses 16 sticks to create a branch slab
          2 NEW SPRITES branch block (two textures, sides and faces)
    -Tied Block of Sticks (fixed in air, like mortared cobble)
          right click block of sticks with rope
        
    -thatch (using wicker block)
          created with reeds and branches/sticks and maybe string/fiber?
          antigravity naturally, but falls/breaks when walked on
          
    -grass piles that dry into straw piles. Full block can be tied to become "Bale of Straw"

-Add Haybales, packable and piston shovelable
```~~~```

***CLAY JAR CONCEPT***
-Holds water like a bucket and can be used in recipes requiring a bucket

-Can be placed (both water filled and not)

-Can be used to milk cow, 

-Can be filled with shafts (up to 64)
-Can be filled with branches
-Can be filled with arrows

-Eye of ender acts as a palantir, you peer into it to gain insight on where you should go

-lsd dREAM simulator as the HARDCORE NIGHTMARES thing

-New records
    >MGMT's "Days that Got Away"

-Pipe smoking
    >whittle pipe with chisel/knife
    >craft with hemp, new item "Packed pipe" created (alternatively, hold right click to load pipe?)
    >hold right click to take a hit. Longer hold = different/more debilitating effects
    >Suck in for too long and take damage, Steve says OOF

-an oar item, for propelling on a boat without hemp

-Animal hunger and food value tweak, animal taming and behaviors?

----
BTW INDIE GAME CONCEPT:

A Minecraft clone survival game without an inventory. Players have both hands at their disposal. First person perspective
Logs carried on back. A backpack can store useful items 
Limited world manipulation until good tools are found, like BTW
Rather than a crafting grid, players combine components by mashing them together with both hands. This is like the "knitting" system in BTW, only everything works like that (with varying crafting times)
    >For example, sharpening a stick is stick in one hand + sharp stone/flint in the other. The animation will be unique: player sharpens end of stick downward
        >the stick can be unfinished. Every object the player deals with is unique and can exist in varying states of damage (rather than generic stacks like in MC)

---


Long term TODO: Wood widdling/carving recipes
    > bowls, totems, 
    
Implement more crops
    
Long term TODO: chop logs in half for log slabs and siding

MEGA FEATURES:
-Chunkloading at new spawns/first campfire (or some nifty way to tell if picked a spot to settle down... maybe wet clay???)
-Chunkloader "totem" that can change the HC Spawn Chunkloaded spot once

---
Really Crazy Ideas:
-Make animals startle just by getting too close?
Nah, that's lame.

-Animals automatically run from mobs?
Could be fun, maybe hard to implement.

-rib cooking over campfire has custom animation where it is hanging from each stick like smoking a pig

-smokable pipe!!!!

Mark idea: Twigs snap under foot, making a loud snapping sound that could attract mobs
