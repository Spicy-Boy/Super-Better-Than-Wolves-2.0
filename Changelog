SBTW VERSION 2.0
Started August 8, 2022
Switched to BETA 2.0 on July 12, 2023

2.4 BORDER CONTROL UPDATE:

COMMENT OUT serverLoc cheat

- Added/Changed the config file to be more descriptive and organized
    -SBTW.properties is now located inside the config folder at the root of the server/.minecraft

TODO- Added the evil egg

TODO- Add configuration for changing the respawn radius from spawn chunks to any coordinate you like!
... really, we just need a new way to change the actual spawn chunks

- Added server configs to SBTWserver.properties that allows server admins to enable and set a custom HC respawn and exclusion radius

- Added the /smite [playername] command for admin use

- Added a server config to SBTWserver.properties that enables a world border forcefield at a default radius of 5000 blocks in every direction
    - The world border is rectangular and centered around 0,0, but the origin can be changed to spawn in the config
    - The world border dimensions (both x and z axis) can be set in the config

TODO- Added the /name [name] command to allow players to name their favorite items

2.3 Punish All Cow Abusers Update:

- Added the ctrl key as an alternative sprint button. This cannot be rebound at this time.
    > If rebinding your ctrl key is something important to you, then please reach out to me and I can make it configurable. 
    > I just didn't feel like coding that right now, and I won't bother if it isn't something anyone will use

- Added the treat, a special item for your dog. Show some love to your canine companion and he might give some right back!
    >Another Sockthing classic texture

- Added a server config to SBTWserver.properties that toggles team spawns on initial login (functions like /set spawn)
    >basically, instead of starting at spawn, new players will begin at the location set by their respective team
    >if a player is not a member of a team, they will spawn at the "default" team location (use /tpteam set default) 

- Added a server config to SBTWserver.properties that toggles HC Spawn on initial login
    >basically, instead of starting at spawn, new players in a server start at a random HC spawn
    >players will spawn near each other due (I think) to hardcore soulmating, which helps performance

NOTE: If both team start and HC start are enabled at the same time, then players will random HC spawn rather than go to team default

- Added the /deaths command that informs the player how many times they have died in the current world.

- Changed/replaced the librarian trades for bookshelves and redstone with trades to purchase block dispensers and detector blocks

- Changed the level 3 Librarian level up trade to a buddy block since you can now buy BDs from him

- Changed/swapped around the blaze powder and bat wings librarian trade because, IMO, bat wings are a lot harder to farm than blaze rods!

- Changed the level 2 priest trades to be more desirable. Before, the trades consisted of random trash enchantments.
    >The priest knows how to use the enchanting table a lot better than you do tbh

- Added a super secret trade for epic loot    

- Changed spawners to spread mossy stone to loose cobble as well as mortared 

- Changed/tweaked Hardcore Hoofsies to demand a little bit more respect than the community has been giving lately... >:)
    >Holding a tasty snack will make hoofsies much more forgiving of hugsies

- Changed campfires to startle animals when placed
    
- Changed trap doors to be climbable when placed above ladders

- Changed mycelium to grow in complete darkness. It didn't really make sense that it needed sunlight.

- Fixed an issue where loose dirt was breakable by zombies... sorry :)    
    
- Fixed a long standing issue where villager trades would not refresh properly (thanks CE team!)

TODO- Added lightning tweaker config option

TODO- Reconfigure blacksmith trades to make a bit more sense

TODO- Change wither from bone blocks back to soulsand :P (maybe axe infused skulls entirely because why we gotta do that??)

TODO- Fixed a bug/oversight/lie that caused netherrack to not poison animals when pulverized. Nothing to worry about honestly, carry on.
        TODO>Apply the same principle to soul filtering. Thank you Dawn for pointing all of this out!

TODO- Added the blowpipe, a new tool that can be used to blow bottles and jars from hot, molten, gloryhole glass
        TODO> add a particle effect to show that the glass is cooking inside the gloryhole

TODO- Added the glass jars from Sockscrops! They can store smaller items!

TODO- Added the Meat Golem

TODO- Added the airship

TODO- Added the pipe
        >Used to rip fat clouds

2.2 Brick & Mortar:

- Added thatch, a new roofing material made of sticks and reeds
    >Caution, this material is weaker than wood and may not stop a hungry zombie!
    
- Added pitfall traps! Try setting them with thatch and another unstable block
    
- Added straw thatch, a thatch variant that swaps reeds for straw
    
- Added more reasonable recipes for acquiring wool blocks and platforms that are not dependent on wicker weaving    

- Added two creative-only blocks: super glass and super block
    > Super glass is bedrock but see-through
    > Super blocks are also just retextured bedrock

- Added three new player-to-player teleportation commands: /tpa [player name], /tpaccept [player name], and /tpcancel

- Added /tpteam commands for setting up teams of players and teleporting them as a group
    >/tpteam list, /tpteam list [teamname], tpteam refresh, /tpteam [teamname], /tpteam player [playername], /tpteam new [teamname], /tpteam set [teamname], tpteam remove [playername], tpteam add [playername]
    >TODO: configuration to make players spawn at their team location on first enter server

- Added a new configuration file, SBTWserver.properties, to servers (auto-generated on start up) that allows server owners to disable or enable SBTW's new tpa commands

- Added the tombstone, a block that can be crafted by chiseling a slab of stone   

- Added Hardcore Nightmares... remember, it is just a dream!
        
- Added part of Tsughoggr's Gloryhole and Blow mod to SBTW
        > Adds the gloryhole, an oven-like block that can be used to create blocks of glass when filled with sand from the top and heated from below
        > Changed the gloryhole recipe to require a block of obsidian rather than nether quarts
        
- Added a new breeding method for wolves-- mystery meat! Credit to the CE team for this one. 
    >Kibble is out, which will make dog armies a little tougher to make. I intend to make a non-mystery meat breeding item too for this purpose, but kibble isn't it folks
    >Wild wolves can breed now

- Changed bread dough and mud brick crafting to maintain the full bucket of water between crafts. No more refilling
    > This is a stopgap. Ideally, this behavior will be based on nearby water sources. Working on it!

- Changed the anchor recipe to require an iron nugget rather than an ingot (steel nugget too because why not?)
      
- Changed/reverted glass to the state of not allowing monsters to spawn on top of it. No more need to light up large glass structures!
        
- Changed the chat window during sleep to be toggled off by default. Press "t" while sleeping to chat. 

- Changed hearty stew to mainly be produced with beef. This makes stew less of a braindead endgame food option and more of a project to obtain automatically
        >Notably, you can't make stew with pork, mutton only produces two servings of stew, and wolf chops only produce 3 servings. Fry up some eggs mate.        
    
- Fixed an issue that caused the player to wake up from rain even when it wasn't really raining on the bed due to rounding problems
    
- Fixed crude torch pickup. There was a bug where right clicking a torch would sometimes cause the torch to be placed in the inventory invisibly
        
2.1 Hotfix:

- Added a missing file that caused a rendering crash! Oops!!! Sorry!!!

2.0 Additions:

-TEMPORARY OMISSION for BETA 2.0: Biome decorator places standard gourds with vanilla seeds/plants
    >@ the request of Wario-Luigi Hybrid

-Added SLEEPING! 
    >Like in Arminias mod/CE 1.4, the world is simulated during sleep. Time is not skipped! Monsters still lurk outside...

-Added Hardcore Soaked!  

-Added the bedroll from CE 1.4. You can sleep on this! Great for camping trips. 
    >Three recipes: wool knit + wool knit + string OR unknit wool OR two feathers

-Added the ability to pick up torches and bricks with an empty handed right click

-Added the ability to pick up torches and bricks by right clicking them. No more fumbling!

-Added 9 new seeds for each type of pumpkin and melon WOW!

-Added new item: Bucket of Mortar
    >right click to apply mortar to a block, depletes contents of bucket (16 uses)

- Added new tool: the trowel
    >right click to apply mortar from your inventory

-Added new block: Wet Mud Bricks
    >Can be dried in the sun or baked in a kiln to produce bricks more efficiently than with clay balls alone

-Added more efficient recipes for tanned leather armor
    >crafted using cut tanned leather in the 2x2 crafting grid, like untanned leather
    
-Added rib cracking: use a sharp axe to quickly get meat off a rib
    >the rib itself is reduced to bonemeal in the process

-Added the ability to cure ribs with nitre

-Added the Time Cube to the creative menu (WARNING: I am not responsible for any corruption that temporal shenanigans unleash upon your world)

-Added lava and powered axle to creative menu

Changes/Fixes:

-Changed wolves to breed to produce untamed puppies. This opens up some options :)

-Changed the ender goggle overlay to be transparent in places so you can see somewhat while wearing them

-Changed pumpkin seeds to stack to 64 rather than 16 for storage and automation purposes OH NO MY INVENTORY BALANCE!!!!!!!!

- Changed pumpkin and melon varieties to grow by seed rather than biome. 
    >EX: a yellow pumpkin requires a yellow pumpkin seed to grow.

-Changed the ender spectacle overlay to be easier to see through

-Changed dead bushes to be a little tougher and made some more bountiful than others

-Changed FCAddOn to no longer display a V next to version number when loading into a world.. for pretty much no reason

-Fixed the lighting bug that caused hampers and such to look completely pitch black (thanks Dawn, Hiracho, and the CE team!!!)

-Fixed a game bricking bug that created a ticking tile entity or something when using a piston shovel to pick up ash.

-Fixed an issue in which the vase was also a Time Cube 

-Fixed a quirk where ribs looked kind of buggy to eat. That was my attempt at making them take longer to chew, but it looked sort of dumb

- ~ - ~ -

#############################################################
VERSION 3.0 Speculative TODO
Additions:

O- FIX The sword seam issue in the rendering caused by mc patcher

O-Custom death message for being stabbed to death by a knife. Also, clubs if there isn't one already.

O-New in-world crafting recipe: Pile of sticks -> Campfire
        right click branch/stick against top of block to place it down just like pregenerated branch blocks in forest
        right click again to create "X" of sticks (drops 2 sticks)
        right click again to add another stick on top (drops 3 sticks)
        right click again to create a campfire

***GOURD TODO***
O-Pumpkin Jack hitboxes do not conform to model... can that be fixed?

O-LEARN HOW HYDRATION AND PLANTS WORK IN MC

O-SNOW SMOTHERS CROPS

****

-!-Enderman Overhaul-!-

O-Remove purple particles from enderman

O-Make sounds way less frequent

O-Have endermen head look at you most of the time

-!-!-!-!

O- Added Yany's Hardcore Hell from Yany's Stuff&Things Addon
        >https://www.sargunster.com/btwforum/viewtopic.php?t=9873&start=25
        >Big shout out to Yany, creator of amazing addons

O- Envelope item
    >stores nbt data of item, right click or uncraft to unwrap present

O-Add new gourd type, Wild Gourd

O-hardcore wittling

O-add pine box (basket copy with new texture, maybe high pitched sped up creak sound effect from normal chest?)
    -Takes 7 minutes total?
    -Wood Carving recipe (iron knife + spruce log)
    -UNCRAFT into knife with 1 reduced durability and + second item (Unfinished Wooden Box) that maintains the progress/damage value to be resumed
    

+=+=+ NEW CROPS / FARMING TWEAKS +=+=+
O - Changed how potatoes grow. 
   - Planting a potato in farmland buries it (use Sockthing's carrot/onion). Drops potato on first stage. Drops nothing if advances.
   - It will grow greenery out of top and eventually expand to cover the whole block (usual multi-potato texture). Drops 2-3 potatoes.
   - When fully grown (before flowering stage), begins to expand into adjacent fallow farmland. Colonist potato plants use a different texture


O- Added new types of rivers for each biome

O- Added wild carrots
    >Generate on the tops of mountains
    
O- CONSIDER ADDING FOUL SEED from corrupted pumpkin?? Creates a vine that never stops growing
        >grows infinitely
        >tough stem needs axe to cut through
        
        >Thorny, hurts players like modern berry bushes do
        >corrupted flowers spread corruption up to 10 blocks away
            >normal pumpkin stems will create corrupted flowers if within range of the nether portal
            >corrupted flowers create corrupted pumpkins, a black pumpkin with glowing red jack colors

MISC IDEAS:

```~~~```NEW EARLYGAME BLOCKS```~~~```
    O  - add reed thatch AKA new wicker block (described below, cant be walked on or used as support antigravity block)
        3 branches/sticks, sandwiched by 6 reeds
        can be broken with bare hand to retrieve block
        spider does not trigger fall
        
       NOTE ON IMPLEMENTATION: YOu can do this pretty easily, look at the snow code!!!!!!! Blocks of snow fall when walked on or when a block is placed on top of them

***CRUSHABLE BLOCK TYPE***
Thatch Properties:
    -can float (thatch, not branches)
    -"update" falls if walked on
    -if a falling block like cobblestone falls on it, the block is crushed into a few sticks with CRACK sound

    -Bundle of Sticks (halfslab, full block is block of sticks)
          place by shift right clicking on a spot with branches in hand, uses 16 sticks to create a branch slab
          2 NEW SPRITES branch block (two textures, sides and faces)
    -Tied Block of Sticks (fixed in air, like mortared cobble)
          right click block of sticks with rope
        
    -thatch (using wicker block)
          created with reeds and branches/sticks and maybe string/fiber?
          antigravity naturally, but falls/breaks when walked on
          
    -grass piles that dry into straw piles. Full block can be tied to become "Bale of Straw"

-Add Haybales, packable and piston shovelable
```~~~```

***CLAY JAR CONCEPT***
-Holds water like a bucket and can be used in recipes requiring a bucket

-Can be placed (both water filled and not)

-Can be used to milk cow, 

-Can be filled with shafts (up to 64)
-Can be filled with branches
-Can be filled with arrows

-Eye of ender acts as a palantir, you peer into it to gain insight on where you should go

-lsd dREAM simulator as the HARDCORE NIGHTMARES thing

-New records
    >MGMT's "Days that Got Away"

-Pipe smoking
    >whittle pipe with chisel/knife
    >craft with hemp, new item "Packed pipe" created (alternatively, hold right click to load pipe?)
    >hold right click to take a hit. Longer hold = different/more debilitating effects
    >Suck in for too long and take damage, Steve says OOF

-an oar item, for propelling on a boat without hemp

-Animal hunger and food value tweak, animal taming and behaviors?

----
BTW INDIE GAME CONCEPT:

A Minecraft clone survival game without an inventory. Players have both hands at their disposal. First person perspective
Logs carried on back. A backpack can store useful items 
Limited world manipulation until good tools are found, like BTW
Rather than a crafting grid, players combine components by mashing them together with both hands. This is like the "knitting" system in BTW, only everything works like that (with varying crafting times)
    >For example, sharpening a stick is stick in one hand + sharp stone/flint in the other. The animation will be unique: player sharpens end of stick downward
        >the stick can be unfinished. Every object the player deals with is unique and can exist in varying states of damage (rather than generic stacks like in MC)

---


Long term TODO: Wood widdling/carving recipes
    > bowls, totems, 
    
Implement more crops
    
Long term TODO: chop logs in half for log slabs and siding

MEGA FEATURES:
-Chunkloading at new spawns/first campfire (or some nifty way to tell if picked a spot to settle down... maybe wet clay???)
-Chunkloader "totem" that can change the HC Spawn Chunkloaded spot once

---
Really Crazy Ideas:
-Make animals startle just by getting too close?
Nah, that's lame.

-Animals automatically run from mobs?
Could be fun, maybe hard to implement.

-rib cooking over campfire has custom animation where it is hanging from each stick like smoking a pig

-smokable pipe!!!!

Mark idea: Twigs snap under foot, making a loud snapping sound that could attract mobs
