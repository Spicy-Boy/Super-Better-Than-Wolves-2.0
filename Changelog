IDEAS:
-New construction material type with special property: wicker/thatch roofing
    >Wicker/thatch cannot be used to hold up a player, entity (other than spiders maybe), or block like sand/cobblestone anything that falls

    >Suck in for too long and take damage, Steve says OOF

-wolves breed to make untamed puppies, so they can be farmed

-an oar item, for propelling on a boat without hemp

-Animal hunger and food value tweak, animal taming and behaviors?

-FIX melon stems break instantly, make them tough! 

-give each gourd type its own seed (or split small and large)
    -give each gourd type different amounts of slices and seeds dropped (largest = 3, medium = 2, small = 1)

----
BTW INDIE GAME CONCEPT:

A Minecraft clone survival game without an inventory. Players have both hands at their disposal. First person perspective
Logs carried on back. A backpack can store useful items 
Limited world manipulation until good tools are found, like BTW
Rather than a crafting grid, players combine components by mashing them together with both hands. This is like the "knitting" system in BTW, only everything works like that (with varying crafting times)
    >For example, sharpening a stick is stick in one hand + sharp stone/flint in the other. The animation will be unique: player sharpens end of stick downward
        >the stick can be unfinished. Every object the player deals with is unique and can exist in varying states of damage (rather than generic stacks like in MC)

Long term TODO: Wood widdling/carving recipes
    > bowls, totems, 
    
Implement more crops
    
Long term TODO: chop logs in half for log slabs and siding

MEGA FEATURES:
-Chunkloading at new spawns/first campfire (or some nifty way to tell if picked a spot to settle down... maybe wet clay???)
-Chunkloader "totem" that can change the HC Spawn Chunkloaded spot once

---
Really Crazy Ideas:
-Make animals startle just by getting too close?
Nah, that's lame.

-Animals automatically run from mobs?
Could be fun, maybe hard to implement.

-rib cooking over campfire has custom animation where it is hanging from each stick like smoking a pig

-smokable pipe!!!!

Mark idea: Twigs snap under foot, making a loud snapping sound that could attract mobs
