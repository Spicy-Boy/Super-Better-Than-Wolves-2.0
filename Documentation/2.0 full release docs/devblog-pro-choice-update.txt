In my notebook, I have the date [DATE] marked as the "Best Day of my Life". Absolute addrenaline rush of a day 

>LINKS TO VIDEOS!!!

Viewers in TDLMC's stream asked a few really obvious questions that I didn't have an immediate answer for: "What is SBTW?" "What is different about SBTW?" People wanted to know if it was a harder version of the game, and some players responded that it was "easy mode." I guess it is easy compared to 2020 BTW?
