In my notebook, I have the date [DATE] marked as the "Best Day of my Life". Absolute addrenaline rush of a day 

>LINKS TO VIDEOS!!!

Viewers in TDLMC's stream asked a few really obvious questions that I didn't have an immediate answer for: "What is SBTW?" "What is different about SBTW?" People wanted to know if it was a harder version of the game, and some players responded that it was "easy mode." I didn't make SBTW to be an EZ mode for noobs, I wanted to make an interesting new earlygame with lots of ways to approach the progression beyond the tired old chunks>chisel>craftingstump speedrun. Certainly, SBTW's changes from 2020 BTW are no more progression bending than the CE changes. Here's a handy timeline:

20xx: Flowerchild departs 
> CE 1.0 released
> Zhil gives Aaron the BTW-gradle
> Aaron begins work on SBTW
> CE XX released
> Aaron finally releases SBTW 1.0
> Arminias ports Awoken Dreams to BTW
> Aaron begins work on SBTW 2.0, with the stated goal of adding 
> CE 2.X releases, adding Sinew

Regardless, I decided to take the criticism to heart and create a robust configuration file that players can use to change SBTW's "easy mode" features back to their Flowerchild defaults. So there-- SBTW is HARDMODE now. Not that anyone that cares about that sort of thing will play SBTW anyway, I imagine. ;p

Here is a peek at this new properties file:
<spoiler>

# Toggles whether or not bolts of lightning can start fires..the horror....the horror..
Enable-Lightning-Fire=true

# If enabled, you will respawn within a set range, unchanging!
Enable-Custom-HC-Respawn-Radius=false

# vvv The HC respawn radius decided by you..
Set-Custom-Respawn-Radius=8000

# vvv The inner disc of the HC Spawn radius within which nobody can spawn..
Set-Custom-Respawn-Exclusion-Radius=100

# Turn this off to stop torches from emitting light when held in the hand!
Enable-Dynamic-Torches=true

# Turn this off to restrict leather armor crafting to the crafting table
Enable-2x2-Leather-Armor-Crafting=true

# Turn this off to stop branches from falling from trees or generating!
Enable-Branches=true

# Turn this off to experience the original BTW hunger bar properties.. (ex: can't jump on famished)
Enable-Hunger-Tweaks=true

# Hardcore bouncing prevents block placement while airborn. Disabled by default in SBTW!
Enable-Hardcore-Bouncing=false

TODO: Disable sleeping config ;p true hardcore

</spoiler>

That's right. You can disable lightning fire. You can disable hardcore spawn. You can enable block-jump-placement. You can even turn off Dynamic Lighting and experience caving the OG BTW way. You can make the game harder, and you can make it easier too. Eventually you will even be able to disable sleeping, if for some god forsaken reason you want to experience BTW in its truest hardcore sense.

I am adding a whole load of config options that FC explicitly refused to create. FC rejected broad configs because he wanted to curate a single gameplay experience. He thought (probably correctly) that if there were configs for controversial features like HC Spawn, the majority of players would disable them instead of challenging themselves to experience the feature. He didn't want to have to deal with players 

The thing is: I don't care all that much. The great BTW experiment is already a success. FC produced a fantastic survival game with an expansive playerbase that continues to grow even after his parting. If players want to mix up the medicine themselves (as I myself have done since 2018 through modding), then who am I to stop them? I can pontificate about the benefits of HC Spawn all day, but I gain very little by coercing inexperienced players into running with it. On the contrary, giving players the option to play without Hardcore Spawn might reveal to them why HC Spawn is actually a fun thing in the first place. Or they will just play and have fun in their own way. 

At this point, the real ideological challenge facing BTW in 2024 is convincing players to stick with a single world in the first place. While I appreciate the massive surge in interest that TDLMC's content has brought to BTW, the trend of playing exclusively in "Hardcore Mode" is giga-lame. This new generation of BTW players is obsessed with pure difficulty, and they treat worlds as disposable. For them, the difficulty of BTW is the be-all-end-all with "beating" the game as the ultimate goal of the experience. In my mind, this is a perversion of the whole point of BTW. FC didn't sit down one day and code up a bunch of insane challenges for the sake of torturing blind players. No, BTW's hardcore modes were built up in layers over the course of years in order to expand upon aspects of the game.

The challenge exist to give you a reason to actually play Minecraft. In BTW, the mechanics have you build functional defensive structures, increasingly complex farms, and even practical roadways. BTW gives Minecraft a much needed sense of progression, lengthening the early game while imbuing the later game with purpose. To put it another way: BTW makes it so that you aren't just larping in a sandbox--the game is hard enough that planning and building is actually rewarded.

Enough ranting

~ STORY TIME ~

In my IRL diary, I have January 20, 2024 marked as "The Awesomest Day Ever." I started a new job, I hosted a hugely successful (it didnt explode) [url="https://forum.btwce.com/viewtopic.php?t=10282"]Hunger Games Server[/url], and TDLMC streamed gameplay of my mod to hundreds of people! Extremely validating, I have never felt so fulfilled in my life. There is no high in this world like the euphoria of sharing your creations and having people engage with them. Even if it is just a niche mod of a mod of a block game, I was so amped up that I became physically exhausted. I could barely even participate in my own Hunger Games server that day.

I am grateful to TDLMC for giving me a moment in the sun and all the kind people that have reached out with interest in SBTW. Super special thanks to Fabio and Wario-Luigi-Hybrid/Alfredus Magnus for taking SBTW very seriously and completing entire tech tree runs of the mod. Your feedback and bug reports have been invaluable to development. 

All that said, having all these eyes on my project did come with its small share of chafing. Mainly, folks in TDLMC's streams would ask a few really obvious questions that I was not prepared to answer: "What is SBTW?" "What is different about SBTW?" People wanted to know if it was a harder version of the game, with others deriding it as "EZ mode". I decided to write up a brief timeline:
