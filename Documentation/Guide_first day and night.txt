In Minecraft, you start with nothing but your bare hands and about ten minutes of daylight. After ten minutes, the sun sets and the monsters come out to play.

If you are caught outside after dark, you will in all likelihood be eaten alive. Even if you do manage to fight your way through the night and survive, you will be so exhausted that starvation will be inevitable come morning. 

Surviving your first night in Better Than Wolves takes planning, cunning, and a little bit of luck. It is easy to get overwhelmed, but *Don't Panic!* If you stay calm and stick to a solid gameplan, you will survive and thrive.

A successful first day strategy can be broken down into three basic parts, FOOD, FUEL, AND SECURITY.

MAIN OBJECTIVES FOR DAY 1:

Step 1: Hunt for food

~~~~~~WHAT TO DO FIRST~

"IT'S MINECRAFT. PUNCH A TREE" - CODER 39

NOTE: If you don't see a single tree, turn immediately to page XXX.

~Take Stock~

Welcome to Minecraft, this is your new home. Before rushing off like a ninny and getting yourself killed, take stock of your surroundings.

In any survival situation, taking a second to breath and come up with a plan will increase your chances of not dying significantly.



~~~~~~STEP 1: HUNTING FOR FOOD~


	If you fail to find anything to eat, you will starve and die. Keeping yourself fed is your top priority in Better Than Wolves, and forgetting to feed yourself will always lead to trouble down the road. 

	Players will sometimes skip
	
	Remember, you can't eat diamonds.

~Spooking the Herd~

Minecraft animals might be stupid, but they aren't going to let you 

~Poisonous Forage~

These mushrooms will not make you big and strong, nor will they give you interesting visions. Red mushrooms will only poison you. That said, poison can never actually kill you, so for the price of hearts you can fill your stomach just a smidge. 

It is not recommended that you eat red mushrooms at all when you can afford it, but especially don't eat them when you are already weakened or hungry. If you have plenty of hearts, however, lining your stomach in exchange for a few moments of poisoning might provide a buffer against starvation down the line. 


~~~~~~STEP 2: GATHERING FUEL~

	



	
~~~~~~STEP 3: MAKING A SAFE SHELTER~


~Tip: KEEPING TRACK OF TIME~


~~~~~~Camping 101: How to Cook~

Comfortable and secure in your hidey hole? Good. We can make it even cozier by lighting a fire and roasting your hard-earned meat.

~Lighting a Campfire~ 

1. Start by crafting a campfire. This is done with 4 sticks in your crafting grid. Branches, shafts? Both are fine.

2. Place the campfire down anywhere you like, preferably not blocking your exit.

3. Next you need to add a "spit" to hang the food over the fire with. Craft a pointy stick.

4. Right click the campfire with your pointy stick. Now it is a spit!
V
5. Hang food over the campfire by right clicking the spit with a piece of uncooked meat in your hand.
V
6. Great! All there is left to do now is *light the fire*.
Craft a fire plough.

7. "Fire plough" is the technical term for the fire-starting apparatus that is created by... rubbing two sticks together.

In order to start a fire with this plough, simply hover your curser over the campfire and hold *right click*.

Yes, this process takes considerable energy and a long time.

A very long time... have faith!
[Still actively plowing]

TADA! FIRE!

Notice that it takes about half the fire plough's durability just to start one measely fire. 


~Feeding the campfire~

This fire is dinky. You can get it hotter by adding fuel.

Press [Q] to drop the item in your hand. 
Alternatively, right click the fire with a piece of fuel to automatically burn it.
